# MOOC-Degree
A list of all the online courses I have taken which matches both an MBA as well as the set of courses taken in a traditional bioinformatics MS and took the liberty to add electives that I saw interesting and matched my educational goals.

I mainely took courses offered by Coursera as they accorded me financial assistance for the certifcates and I audited some on other plateforms as well.
